$make basic
$./basic /tmp/fusedir
$ls -l /tmp/fusedir

At this point `echo "blah" > mountpoint/cs` doesn't work though a plain old 
write() does the trick. I have no idea why. Find a small program for 
testing purposes in test/.

$test/wt /tmp/fusedir /tmp/fusedir www.glendix.org
$cat /tmp/fusedir/cs
